------------a.c------------------
Guessing about 40 instructions for this


Cycle for the first C is cycle nr 27

First is 13; The last floating point is the lop id 713 since its 7 instructions and 100 iterations


The clock cycle for this is 317

------------b.c------------------

Guessing one loop is about 11 clock cycles

Turns out its the same amount of intructions but the fadd is replaced with fmadd.

This finished at clock cycle 654.
This is because fmadd is a much more costly instruction than fadd. due it being multiplication

--------------------intopt.c-----------
the biggest stalls are from fmadd, fmul, fneg, compare
basically all floating point


Rename register is to abstract logical and fysical registers.
It is done to avoid false data depence rising from reuse of registers.
